# Edge_Detection_Analysis
Hayat White (Hayat-White)

The General Research problem is which edge detector from Sobel, Canny, Laplacian, and Prewitt is best to help aid in object detection algorithms. The Object detector that will be used will be Tiny yolov2. The Primary Research Questions are which edge detectors aid Tiny yolov2 the most in detecting the most amount of objects accurately.
