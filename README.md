# Edge_Detection_Analysis
Hayat White (Hayat-White)

The General Research problem is which edge detector from Sobel, Canny, Laplacian, and Prewitt is best to help aid in object detection algorithms. The Object detector that will be used will be YOLOV8N. The Primary Research Questions are which edge detectors aid in training the YOLOV8N the most when detecting the most amount of objects.
